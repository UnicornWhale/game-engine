# game-engine
A java game engine that I worked on to give my roommates in college a place to play around with learning coding. The goal was to allow them to get to the "fun stuff" without needing to worry about the graphics, inputs, etc that would normally require you to learn external libraries or arcane pieces of information about the standard libraries.
